# About this project 
This is intended as a demo application to demonstrate building a dynamic table with row selection and breadcrumbs.

## Requirements
* 1. Fetch data from an API endpoint (www.rawg.io).
* 2. Build the dynamic table component that renders the fetched data with multiple columns
listing some authors.
* 3. Implement row selection functionality that highlights the selected row.
* 4. Display detailed data specific to the selected row in the table or a separate section,
showing books written by this author.
* 5. Implement breadcrumb functionality to show the selected row's path or hierarchy.
* 6. Handle breadcrumb navigation to allow the user to go back to previous levels.
* 7. Apply appropriate styling using CSS.
